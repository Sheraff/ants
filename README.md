Cool tech:
- Data Oriented Design: structure data in contiguous read chunks instead of in objects
- `MessageChannel`: communication between 2 web workers
- `SharedArrayBuffer`: one worker works on data, the other reads it
- `OffscreenCanvas`: worker dedicated to drawing state of simulation

Next:
- Rust to boost perf?
- Actual "ants" sim
